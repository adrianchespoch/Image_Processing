# Image_Processing
This repository covers the fundamentals of digital image processing, including filtering, segmentation, and frequency analysis, with practical Python implementations.

Please create a local copy of the code and required files by cloning the repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/hernanmorales-navarrete/Image_Processing.git

We will use python 3.x (as python2 is not supported anymore). Similarly, we will mainly use jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) for the courses taught at this course.

- Jupyter notebooks are very useful tools for learning programming because they provide a nice visual and interactive interface.
- You can see the results of your code live, instead of waiting till your script (.py) finishes running in a terminal.


To be able to use python and jupyter notebooks in your laptop, there are several options:

#### OPTION 1: Google Colab (see https://colab.research.google.com/):

**Important Note: We highly recommend this option for participants.**

One option is to use Google Colab, for which you would need a Google account, which can be a personal gmail account or an institutional email account supported by Google. The advantage of using Google Colab is that all libraries are installed in a Linux server remotely, so we don't need to worry about compatibility issues, different operating systems, etc. The disadvantage is that Colab provides limited memory and computing resources as everything runs in a cloud, so you can only use it to process small datasets.


1. Log into your Google account.

2. Upload the notebooks and the image data (tiffs and jpgs)

3. Open this notebook:
